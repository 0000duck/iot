  <!--  
    This sample includes references to one or more NuGet packages as both ProjectReference and PackageReference.
    ProjectReferences are used by the repo build to test project updates before they are published as packages to NuGet.org.
    If you want to test the package, type `dotnet build /p:PreferPackageReference=true`

    The PackageReference is intended for most use-cases. To delete the ProjectReference:

      1. Delete the first ItemGroup.
      2. Remove the Condition from second ItemGroup
-->

  <ItemGroup Condition="!$(PreferPackageReference)">
    <ProjectReference Include="$(MainLibraryPath)System.Device.Gpio.csproj" />
  </ItemGroup>

  <ItemGroup Condition="$(PreferPackageReference)">
    <PackageReference Include="System.Device.Gpio" Version="1.1.0-prerelease.20153.1" />
  </ItemGroup>

</Project>
